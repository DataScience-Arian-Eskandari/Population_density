**Population Density and Urban Growth Visualization**
   - **Description**: A data visualization project examining how population density influences city developmentâ€”whether cities should expand horizontally or vertically. Employed both the Vega-Lite library and Tableau to create interactive maps and diagrams that highlight relationships between population density, house prices, energy usage, and public transport infrastructure across different cities worldwide.

   - **Highlights**:
     - Created geospatial maps to compare population densities around the world and their impact on urban planning.
     - Visualized correlations between population density, house prices, and private energy consumption using scatter plots.
     - Illustrated public transport networks in cities (e.g., Singapore and Melbourne) to demonstrate how density affects accessibility and travel efficiency.
     - Explored the societal and intangible toll of low-density living, including effects on community interaction and well-being.
   - **Key Skills**: Vega-Lite, Tableau, data visualization, geospatial analysis, storytelling with data.
